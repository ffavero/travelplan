Basic app (proof of concept) based on Google Maps API.

what is doing:
*Run with the Django framework
*Retrive default location by browser
*Convert insert Location in geograph coordinare
*Calculate distance (km) and draw a draggable track on the map.


todo list:
*Think something more intuitive to set the time/data
*Do/Find better icons
*Make a dummy login form to test random usersID
*User panel preference
*A Nice theme!
*Differents plugins (Twitter...)

*Insert Start (several stops in the middle might be allowed) and End travel in a proper 
  Database (GQL work, might be usefull a satic map with coords to help to search faster?)

The app would be implemented in Python (Django e DB operation) and Javascript (Maps and interface).
