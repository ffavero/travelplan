 eg: http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=Toledo&destination=Madrid&sensor=true 
     http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=40.714224,-73.961452&sensor=true ) 
*Insert Start (several stops in the middle might be allowed) and End travel in a proper 
  Database (GQL work, might be usefull a satic map with coords to help to search faster?)

The app would be implemented in Python (Django e DB operation) and Javascript (Maps and interface).
