Basic app (proof of concept) based on Google Maps API.

todo list:

*Retrive default location by browser
*Convert insert Location in geograph. coordinare (eg: http://universimmedia.pagesperso-orange.fr/geo/loc.htm)
*Insert Start (several stops in the middle might be allowed) and End travel in a proper 
  Database (GQL work, might be usefull a satic map with coords to help to search faster?)

The app would be implemented in Python and Javascript.
