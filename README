Basic app (proof of concept) based on Google Maps API.

what is doing:
*Retrive default location by browser
*Convert insert Location in geograph coordinare
*Calculate distance (km) and draw a draggable track on the map.

todo list:
*Think something intuitive to set the time/data
*Draw an horizontal bar resuming the travel (start, go distance), onclick the gmap canvas show up..
*Button to show up directions map and travel details
*Not sure anmore about JSON stuff.. probably it's enought to take the data from the js code of the 
 google.maps.DirectionsService direction...
*retrive JSON file with info given the Lat and Lng (or set the point and retrive the JSON of the total...
 eg: http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=Milano&destination=Torino&sensor=true 
     http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=40.714224,-73.961452&sensor=true ) 
*Make a dummy login form to test random usersID
*User panel preference
*A Nice theme!
*Differents plugins (Twitter...)

*Insert Start (several stops in the middle might be allowed) and End travel in a proper 
  Database (GQL work, might be usefull a satic map with coords to help to search faster?)

The app would be implemented in Python (Django e DB operation) and Javascript (Maps and interface).
